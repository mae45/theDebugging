## File list :

* README.md

=====================

## Directions(Compiling and runningg the program) :

IDE's verified to run and compile these files are :

* CodeBlocks			- Found the Debugger on CodeBlocks lacking

* Eclipse Oxygen

* Eclipse Neon

* Visual Studio C++ 2010

* Visual Studio C++ 2017 -  This is the one being used. To follow along best use this one. 

=====================

## Directions(Running Program) :

These files create .exe files . That can be in either the
projects debug or release file. It depends on how you have your
IDE set up.
<More if needed otherwise keep as is.

## Project Overview :



Research - Figuring out how to work best with Debugger and what is possible for C++


Finding that I need some assistance to work through a c++ issue, I posted the 
question to stack overflow. 

The first responder settle on the fact that I wasn't using a debugger and that was
very apparent to him. 

By no means do I feel I am a lazy coder. I very rarely turn to forums. But, I wanted 
to start working with stack overflow. 

This brought to mind that I should really buckle down and get into the debuggers. 

That is one of the things I will be working on. That is on top of the many projects
I have planned. 

It just may help me in my development in the long run. 

Looking for collaboration on some of the best ways to debug. Feedback is welcomed. Keep in 
mind that this is for C++ and specifically Win32 GUI. For the more adventurous Arduino Uno. 
That IDE can always use some outside help.


Thank you, mae45
